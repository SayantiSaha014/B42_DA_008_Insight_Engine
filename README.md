INVENTORY ANALYSIS
Inventory analysis is the process of examining data related to stock and inventory to improve how products are managed and stored. This helps businesses ensure that they have the right amount of stock at the right time, avoiding both excess and shortages. By analyzing important metrics like stock levels (how much of each product is in stock), inventory turnover (how quickly items are sold or used), and reorder points (when new stock needs to be ordered), businesses can make smart decisions that save money, reduce waste, and keep customers happy by preventing stockouts or overstocking.

This process uses both past (historical) and real-time data to recognize patterns in product demand, predict future needs, and highlight areas where things may be going wrong, like having too many or too few products in stock. Modern tools, like Power BI, help businesses visualize these trends clearly and track key performance indicators (KPIs) using easy-to-read dashboards. This helps companies make well-informed decisions quickly, ensuring that the right products are available at the right time while minimizing unnecessary costs.
